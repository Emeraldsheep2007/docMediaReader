==================================================

Sorry for uploading too late guys.
I have to say that I am just a student and the process of All of my projects are based on my love of projects.
These are created on my own in my free time.

==================================================

If you have any reports or bugs feedback, please tell me in the 'issue' module on Github.

Just simply run the exe file and you can open a file you ever want, and it would take the media files out.
If it has no media files, it would give an error window and simply tells you.

More functions would come in the future, now I am trying to support doc, ppt and xls format file.
So, stay turned.
